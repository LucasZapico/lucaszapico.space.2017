### Problem
#### Reasoning for Current Fix
There is an implicit market expectation to have some sort of running feed or log showcasing "action". Allowing the interested parties a sudo-production log. For many individuals, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, Github, etc meet this need. Simply put I do not find these as satifactory. I have not felt that my production aligns with the personality of the channels or the expectations of the audiences. So I have forgone action up to this point, but in the paradigm of "shipping beats perfection" and "kaizen" ;). My perceived market value required some sort of solution. Hence the "Pulse"; the primary benefit of my pulse is it exists within the space I have created through Luc.Inc. Therefore, the expectation of the audience has been primed through interaction with the site. To create this same alignment on one of the formal channels would require an investment into those channels, which does not align with my long-term strategy at this time.

*The stable target is to radiate content from a central digital node(website) to all other channels and endpoints. Ideally deploying, interacting and archiving content programmatically. This is a high-level one sentence of my target.*
