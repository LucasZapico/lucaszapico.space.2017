#### Project Consideration
<ul class="browser-default">
  <li>
  Legibility within variable environments
  </li>
  <li>
  Clear hierarchy of elements against business and brand objectives
  </li>
</ul>
Given the nature in which the object was going to be interacted with. We emphasized a clear hierarchy between key elements to ensure the most important information is conveyed to the audience. To meet these needs the elements needed to be legible at a distance, speed, and in low light brought on by various weather conditions and periods of the day. To accomplish this, elements are space weighted and colored for strong contrast and clarity.
