### Need
In order to convey more accurately the value propositions of Luc.inc the case showcase needed a more robust, engaging and informative experience.

#### Why is this important
__Premise__
Marketing
: that is making a promise of value, showcasing outputs that demonstrate said promised value clearly and accurately, then further validating by delivering the expectations of the audience base on the initial promise.


### Solution
To meet this end some market research was in order. First, research and analysis; a survey of digital agencies, branding firms and individual portfolios were examined. I find that for any project a little causal market research is a great way to get a pulse on what is microcore, average, competitive and above and beyond.
The next step is to examine business and project constraints, for example
- Are there any "something is better than nothing" issues?
  - If so how can they be hotfixed so they are not causing damage until a more stable solution can be applied?
- What is the dream scope, want scope & need scope of the project?
- What design, copywriting and showcasing is genuine and accurate to the promise?
> Under promise and over deliver!

This post is addressing the second refactoring which is currently WIP(work in progress) and has begun with the refactoring of the Cohen Group case. This new experience is more detailed and is aiming to convey some of the process, and reasoning without requesting too much investment from the audience.


#### Some favorites from the research with brief summaries

[Red Antler](https://redantler.com/)
: Red Antler...top tier. The whole experience is bold. They start with their promise. Then immediately validate and reinforce that validation by showcasing the brands they have worked with.
It is so strong out of the gate. The amount of information they deliver for each experience point gives value at a glance. Leading but letting the audience find and follow their own path through the information. The quality of their clients is probably enough to drive interest. It is a testament to their brand that they created such a compelling experience despite.

[Bison Studio](https://bison.studio/)
: This is a small firm and they rocked it. The layout is bold and unique and but clean. They had some fun with their transitions and custom pointer. (It's on the todo list). Their copywriting is 'bison' which is a fun touch and leaves the audience clear on the type of team you are getting. They let you know what they do and what they don't. All in all, top notch firm and a benchmark to drive towards.

[Fragment](https://fragment.lv/)
: This experience had a particularly unique thread. Their typography is prime and their information hierarchy is extremely well done. They are boutique firm and their experience mirrors this. They expect a little bit more time for the audience out of the gate. It's just enough to make a statement that aligns back to a boutique approach. This approach contrasted with Red Antler who lead the audience with large at a glance type and visuals before the experience requires more than a tenth of a second to consume the value. The second approach is more likely to induce the audience to progress into the experience because it is a hyper-low investment initially for the audience.
