### Why
A couple of communities have pushed challenges to build and design 404 pages that enhance, or at least mitigate a negative user experience. I interpreted the needs as follows;

#### Experience Objectives
1. relax and inform the audience/user that;
2. something has gone wrong
3. it's not their fault
4. a course of action to allow them to rediscover the value/experience they may have been looking for

#### Action Taken
To meet these criteria/constraints/objectives I took a satirical approach playing with the idea opening a door on a break room, dark coffee shop, maybe a 1950's jazz bar where a dapper fox is reading the newspaper.... well that is my narrative at least. Enjoy.

#### Additions and Iterations
I believe rather than a redirect home/ driving the user to a showcase piece of content. Maybe a little flippantly could enhance or inject levity into the otherwise negative experience.

Also, more comprehensive messaging for the error could show consideration for the audience.

Or see it live by typing in a page that does not exist on this site or click here <a class="link" href="{{site.baseurl}}/404">fox 404</a>
