      <p>Thanks for stopping by and checking out my work. I hope they intrigued and or delivered some value. At this very moment, I am likely jamming away doing one of the following.</p>

      <ul class="browser-default">
        <li>Producing some graphic element</li>
        <li>Developing some process or automation</li>
        <li>Coding up a project</li>
        <li>Learning how to do the previously mentioned better by expanding my proficiency in...
          <ul class="browser-default">
            <li>Project management</li>
            <li>Design</li>
            <li>User experience</li>
            <li>Development</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

  <p>    Needless to say, it is a full plate. But I love this stuff. So pardon not having wonderfully robust project documentation available. I assure you I am working on it and one day it will be a sight to behold. So until then stay classy.</p>
